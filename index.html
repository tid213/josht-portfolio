                    Allow me to introduce myself, I am Josh, a dedicated individual 
                    whose lifelong passion lies in the art of creation and growth. 
                    From my early years, I have been captivated by the process of 
                    constructing things and witnessing the transformative journey of 
                    nurturing life. One of my greatest joys comes from meticulously 
                    mapping out plans and observing them evolve into tangible, 
                    intricate realities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I have discovered interesting parallels between the 
                    preparation, execution, and problem-solving 
                    inherent in the realms of gardening, woodworking, and the dynamic 
                    field of Web Development. The discipline, attention to detail, 
                    and strategic thinking essential to these domains resonate deeply 
                    with me. This recognition has not only fueled my enthusiasm 
                    but also instilled in me a profound appreciation for the 
                    interconnectedness of these diverse yet harmonious spheres.

                                various environmental factors. Observing the distinct

                                Since then, I have cultivated a natural aptitude for

                                signal, which is then transmitted to the Raspberry Pi. 
                                Operating on an Express/Node/MongoDB/Pug stack, the Raspberry 
                                Pi efficiently stores user data, ensuring seamless access for
                                 Green Capz users.

                                To enhance user experience, real-time readings are displayed 
                                through a mounted screen on the enclosure housing the Raspberry 
                                Pi and Arduino boards. While the Arduino board required minimal 
                                C code, this project served as a valuable opportunity for me to 
                                delve into a new programming language, significantly expanding 
                                my skillset in the process.</p>
